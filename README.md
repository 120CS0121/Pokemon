# pokemon
we'll build a tiny implementation of a Pokemon-like game that allows us to create little creatures, feed them to gain health, and let them battle against each other.
By the end of day three we'll understand the basics of object-oriented programming in Python and how we can apply them to build a small game that you can play in our Python REPL(Read Evaluate print loop).
